      <h1>Boba Tea Ordering Kiosk</h1>
      <p>One of the most important aspects of creating an interface that exists 
        in a public space is to consider what kind of persona would use this 
        interface. </p>
      <p>For my UIUX course assignment, I take a look at a Kiosk at
        one of the local bubble tea shops in my area and try to determine the 
        user profile of someone who this product is designed for through a 
        series of interviews, observations, empathy maps, and a storyboard. 
      </p>
      <h1>Sketch and Description</h1> 
      <img class="sketch" src="./assets/sketch.png" alt="an annotated sketch of the Kiosk">
      <p>The kiosk consists of:
        <ul>
          <li>
            a touchscreen application from which you can make orders with
          </li>
          <li>
            a card reader allowing for payment
          </li>
          <li> a menu page: detailing the availability, cost, and photographs of 
            each drink for the user to scroll through. 
          </li>
          <li>
            drink page: allows the user to heavily customize their orders based on 
            things such as ice level, sugar level, quantity, etc, detailing the cost 
            and contents of these customizations, as well as allowing for the user 
            to input special requests. 
          </li>
          <li>
            payment page: user can choose tip 
          </li>
          <li> a phone number page: requires a number to process payment </li>
          <li> users can also link their Snackpass and receive rewards</li>
        </ul>
        It specifically exists as an alternative method for tea-lovers to make 
        purchases at the shop, making the ordering process more streamlined, 
        efficient, and customizable. It also allows for employees to focus on creating the drinks rather than 
        tending to orders. 
      </p>
      <p> When their order is ready, the application automatically messages the 
        number associated with the order for the customer to pick up, allowing 
        for increased customer mobility and order accuracy as well.
      </p>
      <h1>Key Observations</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Users scrolled around and explored items and customizations </li>
          <li> Users actively chose to customize their orders</li>
          <li> No one walked away when it was required the purchase be paid with card </li>
          <li> Some hesitated at the reqiurement to put down their phone number </li>
          <li> Most left a small tip</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h1>Interview Summary</h1>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <!-- TODO: add responses to theses -->
          <li> How do you feel using the kiosk? </li>
          <p> All interviewees responded that the interface was very bright and 
            easy to navigate and understand. If anything, the users who were new 
            to using the kiosk reported it took a bit for them to read through 
            everything, but otherwise throught the device was efficient and clear.
          </p>
          <li> On average, how often would you prefer using the kiosk over ordering at the counter? </li>
          <p>
            Certain interviewees prefered using the Kiosk over ordering at the counter 
            as it gave them more control over their orders. Others preferred it 
            because they preferred not to talk to people. 
          </p>
          <li> What was on your mind when you were using the kiosk?</li>
          <p>
            Everyone was just concerned with picking their order, which meant that 
            the design was invisible and thus non-intrusive and very intuitive.
          </p>
          <li> What's something you would change about the kiosk?</li>
          <p> Many complained about the touchscreen having blips. One particular 
            user did not like that he was required to enter his phone number, as 
            he was afraid of getting promotional spam. 
          </p>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <h1> Personas </h1>
      <h2> Beth </h2>
      <h3> Description</h3>
      <p> Beth is a young adult who just ended a long day of work meetings, and 
        just wants to get a drink or a snack before she goes home to recharge 
        her social battery. 
      </p>
      <img class="empathy-diagram" src="./assets/empathy_beth.png" alt="an empathy diagram for Beth">
      <h3> Problems Encountered</h3>
      <p>
        The touchscreen is not always responsive. Beth struggles with punching 
        in the buttons and feels pressured by the growing line of people 
        behind her. She struggles between asking for an employee's help and 
        her social anxiety.
      </p>
      <h3> Why is Beth a representative persona? </h3>
      <p>
        Beth is clearly a younger, more shy, more tech-savvy young adult who 
        prefers the comfort, freedom, and privacy of using the kiosk over 
        ordering at the counter. At the kiosk, she's under no pressure to answer 
        questions for her order immediately and can do some exploration with 
        shop items. She is used to online shopping, and so understands the 
        application well. She has the disposable income to come to the tea store 
        and thus, tends to leave bigger tips as well. 
      </p>
      <h2> John</h2>
      <h3> Description</h3>
      <p> John is a college-aged student who has classes to attend in 15 minutes 
        and he knows exactly what drink he usually needs to get him through his 
        day.  
      </p>
      <img class="empathy-diagram" src="./assets/empathy_john.png" alt="an empathy diagram for John">
      <h3> Problems Encountered</h3>
      <p>
        John is in a rush. His order is specific and long, and the application 
        sometimes can glitch out or fail to sense his inputs, causing him to 
        lose precious time as if he accidentally clicks through it, he has to
        go back and restart his mistake. He's frustrated that he has to rush 
        and can't just say his order, which would be faster. 
      </p>
      <h3> Why is John a representative persona? </h3>
      <p>
        Like Beth, John is also a younger adult who has experience with online 
        shopping and is very comfortable with using a digital interface and 
        getting drinks to go on the road. His long and specific order can 
        sometimes confuse staff and cause them to make mistakes. However, with a 
        digital interface which records specific choices, he would notice that 
        his orders are processed more efficiently. He has more control over what 
        he wants through the kiosk. 
      </p>
